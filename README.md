# Initium-Track-Attack
Tracks and Stacks Attacks then Tacks them Back


Sup. This is a greasemonkey/tampermonkey script. 
I'm pretty much a noob so feel free to modify this as you want. 
I'd prefer if this is kept inside the group, but that's up to you.

How to use:

1. Install with greasemonkey
~~2. Use clicks when attacking. I commented out the hotkeys because I feel they're pretty buggy and I'm too lazy to debug them. ~~
2. Weird shit. Hotkeys STILL work. I'm guessing Initium just triggers clicks when the shortcuts are pressed. Thank Hod I don't have to debug this.

NOTE: This uses GM_setValue and GM_getValue, which I assume uses localStorage. I bet the values will reset if you clear cache or turn off the script.
